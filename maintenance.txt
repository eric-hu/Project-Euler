1. Refactoring: Periodically go through solved problems looking for common
   utils, extract into a common library

2. Benchmarking: For solved problems, re-solve if an improvement is obvious and
   benchmark the result.  Repeat the benchmark a large number of times to
   smooth out the noise.  Watch the results for automated optimizations by the
   Ruby interpreter (i.e. large runtimes for the first run)
