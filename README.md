Project-Euler
=============

My solutions to project euler exercises.

For now, the coding philosophy of this repo is to use as few libraries as possible.  While this goes against a DRY philosophy, I'm choosing this path first to explore how basic libraries work.

In the future, I may build a branch or fork this repo to try refactoring out my code to use existing libraries.  This will be a good exercise in discovering and employing existing code.
