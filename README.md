Project-Euler
=============

My solutions to Project Euler exercises.

For now, the coding philosophy of this repo is to use as few libraries as
possible.  While this goes against a DRY philosophy, I'm choosing this path
first to explore how basic libraries work.

In the future, I may build a branch or fork of this repo to try refactoring out
my code to use existing libraries.  This will be a good exercise in discovering
and integrating third party libraries.
